## üí° Implementation Guidelines
- Use Workbox for service worker management
- Implement stale-while-revalidate for product data
- Cache-first strategy for static assets
- Network-first for API calls
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Follow PWA checklist from web.dev
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced

## üß™ Testing Notes
- Detected test framework: Jest (from T001 setup)
- Test offline/online transitions
- Verify notification permissions
- Test cache invalidation
- Check update prompts
- Test installation on iOS and Android

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- iOS PWA limitations ‚Äî Provide clear installation instructions
- Cache bloat ‚Äî Implement cache size limits
- Stale data issues ‚Äî Clear cache versioning
- Notification spam ‚Äî Respectful notification strategy

## üîó Reference Pointers
