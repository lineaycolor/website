  - [ ] Await Orchestration Agent's confirmation of successful commit.

## üí° Implementation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implement keyboard navigation for all modals
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Use React Portal for modals
- Optimize for touch devices
- Keep components performant with large product catalogs
- Maintain visual consistency with brand aesthetic

## üß™ Testing Notes
- Detected test framework: Jest + React Testing Library (from T001)
- Focus on interaction testing
- Test modal focus management
- Verify touch gesture handling
- Test filter combination logic
- Performance test with 1000+ products

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- Performance issues with many products ‚Äî Virtual scrolling
- Modal accessibility issues ‚Äî Focus trap implementation
- Touch gesture conflicts ‚Äî Careful event handling
- Animation jank ‚Äî Use GPU-accelerated properties

## üîó Reference Pointers
- Key modules inspected for this sub-task: Collection grid layout
- Animation reference: Gradient animations from `index-v2.html`
- Component library: Build on Next.js setup from T001
- Refer to `info.md` for overarching Technical Guidelines and Critical Files.
