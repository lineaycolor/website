# Fashion Website Next-Level Upgrade - Master Orchestration Plan

## üéØ Overall Mission

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### Technology Stack (Detected & Recommended)
- **Current Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Target Stack**: 
  - Framework: React 18+ with Next.js 14+
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules
  - State Management: Zustand/Redux Toolkit
  - Database: PostgreSQL/Supabase
  - Hosting: Vercel (optimized for Next.js)
  - CDN: Cloudflare

### Package Management
- **Detected**: No package manager currently
- **Recommended**: npm (for consistency with Next.js ecosystem)
- All sub-agents must use `npm` for package installation

### Testing Framework
- **Current**: None detected
- **Target**: 
  - Unit Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
  - E2E Testing: Playwright
  - Visual Testing: Chromatic

### Code Style & Formatting
- **Current**: Manual formatting
- **Target**:
  - ESLint with Airbnb config
  - Prettier for formatting
  - Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - TypeScript for type safety

### Key Patterns to Follow
- Component-based architecture
- Atomic design principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility-first development
- Performance budgets (< 3s FCP)

### Critical Files to Preserve
- `/hero-image.jpg` - Brand hero image
- `/collection*.jpg` - Product showcase images
- `CNAME` - Domain configuration
- Design aesthetic from `index-v2.html` (gradient animations)

## üö¶ Git Protocol for Sub-Agents (CRITICAL)

### Workflow Rules
1. **Pull Frequently**: Always run `git pull` before starting any work
2. **DO NOT COMMIT**: Never run `git add` or `git commit` - the Orchestration Agent handles all commits
3. **Signal Completion**: When task is done, save all changes locally and signal completion
4. **Branch Strategy**: All work happens on `master` branch (as detected)
5. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts arise, signal immediately for intervention

### Commit Standards
- Commits will follow pattern: `[Task-ID]: Brief description of changes`
- Each sub-task gets its own commit for clarity
- No mixing of concerns between commits

## üîÑ Dependency Management & Handoffs
- **Independent Tasks** (T001, T003, T007): Launch immediately in parallel
- **Dependent Tasks** (T002, T004, T005): Wait for T001 framework setup
- **Sequential Tasks** (T006): Requires both T001 and T003

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Breaking Changes**: Each task must ensure existing functionality remains intact
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor Core Web Vitals after each major change
- **SEO Impact**: Maintain current SEO value during migration
- **Design Consistency**: Preserve brand aesthetic across all new components

## üìä Success Metrics
- Page Load Time: < 3 seconds
- Lighthouse Score: > 90 for all metrics
- Mobile Responsiveness: 100% touch-friendly
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Code Coverage: > 80% for new features

## üîó Communication Protocol
- Sub-agents signal completion via status update
- Blocking issues reported immediately
- Cross-task dependencies communicated through Orchestration Agent
- No direct sub-agent to sub-agent communication
