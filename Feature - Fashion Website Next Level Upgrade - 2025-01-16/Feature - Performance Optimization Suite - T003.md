# Task: Performance Optimization Suite Implementation

## 🎯 Mission Brief
Objective: Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including image optimization, lazy loading, caching strategies, and Core Web Vitals improvements
Type: Optimization
Complexity: Moderate

## ✅ Todo Task-List
- [ ] **Analysis**
  - [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on all current pages
  - [ ] Analyze current image sizes and formats
  - [ ] Identify render-blocking resources
  - [ ] Measure current Core Web Vitals
  - [ ] Review network waterfall for optimization opportunities
- [ ] **Design**
  - [ ] Plan image optimization pipeline
  - [ ] Design lazy loading strategy
  - [ ] Create caching strategy for static assets
  - [ ] Plan critical CSS extraction
  - [ ] Design preloading strategy
- [ ] **Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up image optimization with WebP/AVIF generation
  - [ ] Implement responsive image srcsets
  - [ ] Add intersection observer for lazy loading
  - [ ] Configure service worker for offline support
  - [ ] Implement critical CSS extraction
  - [ ] Add resource hints (preload, prefetch)
  - [ ] Configure CDN integration (Cloudflare)
  - [ ] Implement browser caching headers
  - [ ] Add compression (gzip/brotli)
  - [ ] Optimize font loading strategy
- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test lazy loading functionality
  - [ ] Verify service worker caching
  - [ ] Test offline functionality
  - [ ] Measure improved Core Web Vitals
  - [ ] Cross-browser performance testing
  - [ ] Mobile network throttling tests
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document optimization techniques used
  - [ ] Create performance budget guidelines
  - [ ] Document monitoring setup
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] **Review & Cleanup**
  - [ ] Final Lighthouse audit
  - [ ] Verify all optimizations active
  - [ ] Clean up unused assets
  - [ ] Optimize build configuration
  - [ ] **Signal completion to the Orchestration Agent for review and commit.**
- [ ] **Approval**
  - [ ] Await Orchestration Agent's confirmation of successful commit.

## 💡 Implementation Guidelines
- Target 90+ Lighthouse score across all metrics
- Maintain visual quality while reducing file sizes
- Use native lazy loading where supported
- Implement progressive enhancement approach
- Keep original high-quality images for future needs
- Follow mobile-first optimization strategy
- Preserve existing animations performance

## 🧪 Testing Notes
- Detected test framework: None (manual performance testing)
- Use Chrome DevTools for detailed analysis
- Test on real devices with various network speeds
- Verify metrics: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Test with both cold and warm cache

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
- Over-optimization affecting quality — A/B test image quality
- Service worker cache issues — Implement cache versioning
- CDN configuration errors — Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Breaking existing functionality — Progressive enhancement

## 🔗 Reference Pointers
- Key modules inspected for this sub-task: All image assets, CSS files
- Current assets: `/hero-image.jpg`, `/collection*.jpg`
- Performance baseline: Current Lighthouse scores
- Refer to `info.md` for overarching Technical Guidelines and Critical Files.
