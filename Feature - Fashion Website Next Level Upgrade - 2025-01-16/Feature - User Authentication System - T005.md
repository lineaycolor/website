## üí° Implementation Guidelines
- Use NextAuth.js for authentication framework
- Implement JWT with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Hash passwords with bcrypt (min 10 rounds)
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Use Supabase Auth for user management
- Add proper CSRF protection

## üß™ Testing Notes
- Detected test framework: Jest (from T001 setup)
- Focus on security testing
- Test edge cases (expired tokens, concurrent logins)
- Verify email delivery
- Test account lockout mechanisms
- Load test authentication endpoints

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- Security vulnerabilities ‚Äî Regular security audits
- Password breaches ‚Äî Implement haveibeenpwned API
- Session hijacking ‚Äî Secure cookie configuration
- OAuth provider issues ‚Äî Fallback to email/password
