# Task: Modern Frontend Framework Migration to Next.js

## üéØ Mission Brief
Objective: Migrate the static HTML/CSS/JS website to a modern React-based Next.js application while preserving all existing functionality and design aesthetics
Type: Feature
Complexity: Complex

## ‚úÖ Todo Task-List
- [ ] **Analysis**
  - [ ] Review all three existing HTML versions and identify common components
  - [ ] Map current routing structure and page organization
  - [ ] Document all interactive JavaScript functionality to be migrated
  - [ ] Analyze CSS patterns and prepare for Tailwind migration
- [ ] **Design**
  - [ ] Create component hierarchy diagram
  - [ ] Design folder structure following Next.js best practices
  - [ ] Plan data flow and state management approach
  - [ ] Design responsive breakpoint strategy
- [ ] **Implementation**
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS and global styles
  - [ ] Create Layout component with header/footer
  - [ ] Migrate Hero section as reusable component
  - [ ] Create Collection grid components
  - [ ] Implement navigation with Next.js routing
  - [ ] Add gradient animations from index-v2.html
  - [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior on multiple devices
  - [ ] Verify all animations work correctly
  - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Create component documentation
  - [ ] Document prop types and interfaces
  - [ ] Update README with new setup instructions
- [ ] **Review & Cleanup**
  - [ ] Run ESLint and fix any issues
  - [ ] Run Prettier on all files
  - [ ] Remove any console.logs or debug code
  - [ ] Optimize bundle size
  - [ ] **Signal completion to the Orchestration Agent for review and commit.**
- [ ] **Approval**
  - [ ] Await Orchestration Agent's confirmation of successful commit.

## üí° Implementation Guidelines
- Preserve the minimalist aesthetic from the original design
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles alongside Tailwind
- Implement lazy loading for images using Next.js Image component
- Ensure SEO meta tags are properly migrated to Next.js Head
- Keep the gradient animation effects from index-v2.html
- Use TypeScript for type safety throughout
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions

## üß™ Testing Notes
- Detected test framework: None (setting up Jest + React Testing Library)
- Focus on component rendering and interaction tests
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Verify accessibility with automated tests
- All existing visual designs must be pixel-perfect after migration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- Design drift during migration ‚Äî Use visual regression testing
- Performance regression ‚Äî Monitor Core Web Vitals throughout
- SEO impact ‚Äî Implement proper meta tags and structured data
- Breaking existing functionality ‚Äî Comprehensive testing before deployment

## üîó Reference Pointers
- Key modules inspected for this sub-task: `index.html`, `index-v2.html`, `index-improved.html`
- Design reference: Current gradient animations in `index-v2.html`
- SEO reference: Current meta tags in all HTML files
- Refer to `info.md` for overarching Technical Guidelines and Critical Files.
